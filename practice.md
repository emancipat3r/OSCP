HACKING-LAB https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html
Hacking-Lab provides the CTF challenges for the European Cyber Security Challenge, but they also host ongoing challenges on their platform that anyone can participate in. Just register a free account, setup vpn and start exploring the challenges they offer.

PWNABLE.KR http://pwnable.kr/
pwnable.kr focuses on ‘pwn’ challenges, similar to CTF, which require you find, read and submit ‘flag’ files corresponding to each challenge. You must use some sort of programming, reverse-engineering or exploitation skill to access the content of the files before you are able to submit the solution.
They divide up the challenge into 4 skill levels: Toddler’s Bottle, Rookiss, Grotesque and Hacker’s Secret. Toddler’s Bottle are very easy challenges for beginners, Rookiss is rookie level exploitation challenges, Grotesque challenges become much more difficult and painful to solve and, finally, Hacker’s Secret challenges require special techniques to solve.

IO http://io.netgarage.org/
IO is a wargame from the createors of netgarage.org, a community project where like-minded people share knowledge about security, AI, VR and more. They’ve created 3 versions, IO, IO64 and IOarm, with IO being the most mature. Connect to IO via SSH and you can begin hacking on their challenges.

SMASHTHESTACK http://smashthestack.org/
SmashTheStack is comprised of 7 different wargames – Amateria, Apfel (currently offline), Blackbox, Blowfish, CTF (currently offline), Logic and Tux. Every wargame has a variety of challenges ranging from standard vulnerabilities to reverse engineering challenges.

MICROCORRUPTION https://microcorruption.com/login
Microcorruption is an embedded security CTF where you have to reverse engineer fictional Lockitall electronic lock devices. The Lockitall devices secure the bearer bounds housed in warehouses owned by the also fictional Cy Yombinator company. Along the way you’ll learn some assembly, how to use a debugger, how to single step the lock code, set breakpoints, and examine memory all in an attempt to steal the bearer bonds from the warehouses.

REVERSING.KR http://reversing.kr/index.php
reversing.kr has 26 challenges to test your cracking and reverse engineering abilities. The site hasn’t been updated since the end of 2012, but the challenges available are still valuable learning resources.

HACK THIS SITE https://www.hackthissite.org/
Hack This Site is a free wargames site to test and expand your hacking skills. It features numerous hacking missions across multiple categories including Basic, Realistic, Application, Programming, Phonephreaking, JavaScript, Forensic, Extbasic, Stego and IRC missions. It also boasts a large community with a large catalog of hacking articles and a forum for to have discussions on security related topics. Finally, they’ve recently announced they are going to be overhauling the dated site and codebase, so expect some big improvements in the coming months.

W3CHALLS https://w3challs.com/
W3Challs is a pentesting training platform with numerous challenges across different categories including Hacking, Cracking, Wargames, Forensic, Cryptography, Steganography and Programming. The aim of the platform is to provide realistic challenges, not simulations and points are awarded based on the difficulty of the challenge (easy, medium, hard). There’s a forum where you can discuss and walkthrough the challenges with other members.

PWN0 https://pwn0.com/
pwn0 is the VPN where (almost) anything goes. Go up against pwn0bots or other users and score points by gaining root on other systems.

EXPLOIT EXERCISES https://exploit-exercises.com/
Exploit Exercises provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.

RINGZER0 TEAM ONLINE CTF https://ringzer0team.com/
RingZer0 Team Online CTF offers a ton of challenges, 234 as of this post, that will test your hacking skills across multiple categories including Cryptography, Jail Escaping, Malware Analysis, SQL Injection, Shellcoding and more. After you successfully complete a challenge, you can write up your solution and submit it to the RingZer0 Team. If your write up is accepted, you’ll earn RingZer0Gold which can be exchanged for hints during future challenges.

HELLBOUND HACKERS https://www.hellboundhackers.org/
Hellbound Hackers offers traditional exploit challenges, but they also offer some challenges that others don’t such as web and app patching and timed challenges. The web and app patching challenges have you evaluating a small snippet of code, identifying the exploitable line of code and suggesting a the code to patch it. The timed challenges have the extra constraint of solving the challenge in a set amount of time. I thought these two categories were a cool differentiator from most other CTF sites.

TRY2HACK http://www.try2hack.nl/
Try2Hack provides several security oriented challenges for your entertainment and is one of the oldest challenge sites still around. The challenges are diverse and get progressively harder.
