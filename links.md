 I would recommend that you take the time to do a practice exam about 1 week prior to your scheduled exam. This really helped me on my second exam attempt and I honestly believe it was the reason i passed on my second attempt.

About one week prior to my second exam I set aside a day as an “Exam Practice Run”. I used the TryHackMe “Buffer Overflow Prep” from Tib3rius and 4 of the “harder” machines from TJ Null’s PG Practice list. My goal wasn’t to measure my readiness by score but rather to just practice juggling 5 machines at once and get down the time management, required.

I started my practice exam at the same time of day as my exam was scheduled to begin the following week. I took exhaustive notes just like it was the real thing. Most importantly: if I got stuck on a machine for more than 2 hours I moved on. No exceptions. I also took a 5 min break every hour (used a kitchen timer). After 1 hour I had completed the buffer overflow machine. After 8 hours I had enumerated each of the 4 other machines fairly thoroughly. After 12 hours I called it a night. I had several low level shells but no root/admin yet and nowhere near enough “points” for a passing score. However, I learned a lot about juggling notes and terminals for multiple machines, how to take breaks, and how to move on when stuck and come back later with a fresh mind.
